        "---\n> [!NOTE]\n> #### Mandatory upgrade to v4+ with automatic digest pinning for `Kong/public-shared-actions`\n>\n> Renovate is configured to upgrade any `Kong/public-shared-actions` sub-action still on versions below 4 to the latest v4+ version. As part of this upgrade, it will automatically pin each reference to the exact commit digest (and keep that digest refreshed over time).\n>\n> #### Background\n>\n> The `Kong/public-shared-actions` monorepo now publishes per-sub-action tags in the form `<sub-action>@<version>` (for example, `workflow-notification@4.0.1`) instead of plain `vX.Y.Z` tags. Older references like `...@v2` cannot be auto-migrated by tag alone.\n>\n> #### Why tag-only migration is not supported\n>\n> Important: Renovate will not change the tag format for you. Migrating from the older plain `vX.Y.Z` tags to the new per-sub-action tags while keeping tag-only references would require rewriting refs such as `...@v2` to a different tag name like `...@sca@5.1.1`. This contradicts the goal of dependency update automation because it relies on humans to manage tag-name changes and ongoing updates, which our automation is not designed to perform. For this reason, tag-only migration is not supported.\n>\n> Instead, this preset enforces digest pinning. Renovate resolves releases by tag, then writes the reference as the commit SHA for that release with a trailing human-friendly comment (e.g., `...@<sha> # v5.1.1`). Tracking commits rather than tag names keeps updates automated and robust even if tag naming conventions change.\n>\n> #### Security\n>\n> GitHub Actions security guidance recommends pinning third-party actions to a full commit SHA to protect against tag moving and supply-chain attacks.\n>\n> #### References\n>\n> - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions"
